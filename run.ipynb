There's been this ongoing tension, particularly around planning my wedding and the guest list. It's like no matter what I do, I can't seem to make everyone happy. I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of trying to get their approval, but it’s just causing me more frustration and anxiety. I don’t know, maybe I’m just not handling it right or something.\n",

I feel like I can't even express my own thoughts without worrying about how they'll react. It's like if I don't go along with what they want, they'll be upset, and then I start thinking, if they're angry, maybe they'll just pull away from me. I don't know, it just feels like I'm walking on eggshells all the time, trying to keep the peace. I just wish it was easier, you know?\n",

I mean, it’s not like I want to make things worse or create more tension. But then afterward, I find myself worrying a lot, and I can’t sleep. It’s like this constant cycle of trying to avoid conflict but feeling more and more frustrated inside. I just wish I could be more honest without it blowing up in my face. But then again, I feel like if I say anything, it could lead to them being upset, and that thought just terrifies me.\n",

      "Client: I guess when I think about expressing my own opinions, I start to spiral. I think things like, \"What if they get angry?\" or \"What if they think I'm being ungrateful?\" It’s like this voice in my head tells me that if I don’t just go along with them, they might abandon me or not love me the same way. I know it sounds dramatic, but in the moment, it really feels like that. I just don’t want to lose that connection with them, even if it means sacrificing my own feelings. So I just end up keeping quiet, hoping that by doing so, everything will just... stay okay. But then I feel even more trapped, you know?\n",

It’s like a switch flips, and suddenly I’m back in that place of feeling anxious and worried. I mean, I can be having a decent day, and then we start discussing the guest list, and all those thoughts just flood in. I start thinking about how they might react to any suggestion I have, and it just spirals from there. I feel like I have to tiptoe around everything, trying to figure out what’s safe to say. It’s exhausting, really. I just wish I could be myself without feeling like it’s going to lead to a big fallout or something.\n",

      "Client: I don’t know, honestly. Part of me thinks maybe it could lead to a more honest relationship, but then there's this other part that’s just terrified. What if they react badly? What if they take it the wrong way? I worry that if I start speaking up, it could trigger a huge fight or make them pull away from me. And then I think, how would I even handle that? I feel like I’d end up losing something really important, and that thought is just crushing. It’s easier to just keep my mouth shut and go along with their wishes, even if it’s frustrating. But then, I’m left feeling like I’m not really being myself, and it’s like a constant battle inside me. It's just hard to see a way out of this cycle.\n",

      "Client: I mean, I guess exploring it could be helpful, but I just feel like you don’t really get how complicated things are with my family. It’s not just about finding the right words or whatever; it's so much deeper than that. I’ve tried to talk about my feelings before, and it just ends up going sideways. It’s like there’s this huge weight on me, and I don’t know if talking about it will really change anything. I just worry that if I open up, it’ll be like throwing a rock into a pond and watching all the ripples—nothing good ever comes out of it. So, I don’t know if diving into all of this will really help me find a way to speak up without feeling terrified. It's just... overwhelming.\n",

      "Client: I get what you’re saying, and I know you mean well. But it just feels like every time I try to unpack this stuff, it gets messy. It’s not that I don’t want to work through it, but it’s like I’m stuck in this loop of trying to keep things smooth with my family, and the idea of digging into all this feels like it could just make everything worse. I mean, I’ve been there before, and it didn’t end well. It’s just hard to believe that talking can really change anything when it feels so personal and complicated. I’m not sure where to even start without feeling like I’m opening a can of worms. It’s frustrating because I want to feel better, but it’s like I can’t see a clear path forward without worrying about what will happen next.\n",

      "Client: I mean, I hear what you’re saying, and I guess it makes sense in theory. But the idea of digging into those specific thoughts and feelings just feels so daunting. It’s like every time I try to pinpoint what’s bothering me, it opens up a whole new can of worms. I can already feel the anxiety creeping in just thinking about it. I'm just worried that once I start unraveling everything, it could lead to some really uncomfortable conversations with my family, and I honestly don’t know if I can handle that right now. I just keep thinking, what if it makes things worse? It’s frustrating because I want to feel better, but then I feel like I’m stuck in this loop of trying to keep everyone happy while feeling miserable myself.
