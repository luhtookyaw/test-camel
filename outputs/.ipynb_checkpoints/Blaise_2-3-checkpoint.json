I brought up the wedding list with my parents, and it turned into this whole argument. They have these expectations, and I feel like I can never meet them.

We can continue to explore your thoughts and feelings about the situation, keeping the focus on how you felt and what you were thinking during the conversation. We'll work together to understand your experience and find ways to approach similar situations differently in the future. Remember, this is a safe space for you to express yourself, and we'll go at a pace that feels comfortable for you.",
      "client": "I appreciate your consistency and understanding. It really helps me feel more at ease knowing we can keep it focused on my feelings. When I think about that conversation, it’s like I’m right back in that moment, feeling that mix of anxiety and frustration. I wanted so badly to be understood, but it felt like my words were just swallowed up, and I was left feeling even more isolated.\n\nThat tightness in my chest was overwhelming, and I felt so small and powerless. I worry that if we go too deep, it might take me back to that place of feeling unheard and invalidated. I’d like to explore how I reacted and what I was feeling, but I’m really afraid of getting too tangled in the specifics and opening up too much at once. I just hope we can navigate this together while keeping it manageable. I really don’t want to spiral back into those old feelings again.",

      "client": "I really appreciate you saying that again. It’s comforting to know that we can keep focusing on my feelings without getting lost in the details. When I think about that conversation, it’s like I’m stuck in this loop of anxiety and frustration. I wanted to express myself, but it felt like my words just faded away, and that tightness in my chest came rushing back.\n\nI keep worrying that if we dig deeper, it might pull me back into that sense of powerlessness and being unheard. I really want to make sense of those emotions, but I'm scared of what that could lead to. I guess I just want to explore how I reacted and what I was feeling during that conversation without getting too tangled up in the specifics. It’s tough to navigate this balance, but I’m willing to try if we can keep it manageable. I just really need to avoid opening up too much at once.",
      "critic_raw": "**Rating: 2**\n\n**Key Examples:**\n1. \"When I think about that conversation, it really brings back that sense of anxiety and frustration. I felt like I was putting myself out there, trying to make myself understood, but instead, I just felt more invisible.\"\n2. \"I really want to make sense of those emotions, but I’m scared of what that could lead to. I just want to explore how I reacted and what I was feeling during that conversation without getting lost in the details.\"\n\n**Progression:**\nIn the most recent exchanges, the client, Blaise, demonstrates a mix of factual and emotional responses. They express a clear awareness of their feelings of anxiety and frustration, indicating a basic emotional vocabulary. However, there is a noticeable hesitation to delve deeper into these emotions due to fear of feeling overwhelmed. This reflects a warming up stage where Blaise is beginning to trust the therapeutic process but remains cautious about fully opening up.\n\n**Turning Point:**\nThe turning point in Blaise's emotional openness appears when they acknowledge their fear of spiraling back into feelings of powerlessness and being unheard. This admission marks a shift from purely factual recounting to a more emotionally aware dialogue, albeit with reservations about exploring these feelings too deeply. This indicates a budding willingness to engage with their emotions, provided the exploration remains manageable and does not lead to overwhelming vulnerability.",
