We'll identify the cognitive distortions, particularly Fortune Telling and Mind Reading, in your belief that the event will be stressful and that family members will judge you. 2. Gather Evidence: I will guide you in exploring the evidence for and against your thoughts. We'll ask questions like: 'What past experiences support the idea that family members will react negatively?' and 'What evidence suggests that they might be supportive or understanding?' 3. Challenge the Thoughts: We will critically evaluate the thoughts you have about being rejected or judged. For instance, I will ask, 'How do you know they would be ashamed of you?' or 'Have there been times when they showed support?' 4. Reframe the Thoughts: Based on the evidence gathered, we will work to reframe your initial thoughts. Instead of thinking 'They don’t want me there anyway,' we might reframe it to 'I’ve received invitations before, and my family has shown they care about me.' 5. Explore Feelings: We will discuss how you feel when you think these negative thoughts compared to when you consider the alternative perspective. This will help you understand the emotional reasoning behind your beliefs. 6. Develop a Plan: We will create a step-by-step plan for how to approach the wedding. This might include preparing responses to potential questions, setting boundaries with family members, or even planning to attend for a short time. 7. Practice and Link to Behavior: Your task will be to apply this questioning technique in daily situations where you feel anxious about interactions with others. This will help build your confidence in challenging negative assumptions and improve your emotional resilience.",

I will explain the decatastrophizing technique, emphasizing how we can challenge the automatic thought of 'Why does this always happen to me?' and the belief that bad luck is a constant in your life.\n2. Identify Catastrophic Thoughts: Together, we will pinpoint specific catastrophic thoughts related to this situation and your general outlook on life. I'll ask you to articulate what you believe will happen as a result of these events and to explore the worst-case scenarios that come to mind.\n3. Reality Check: After identifying these thoughts, I will prompt you to evaluate their likelihood. We'll discuss how frequently these events actually occur and whether they are truly indicative of a pattern in your life. Questions might include: 'Have you had other experiences where things turned out better than expected?' or 'What evidence do you have that these events define your overall luck or life?'\n4. Generate Alternative Outcomes: I will encourage you to think of more balanced and realistic outcomes instead of extreme scenarios. We'll brainstorm alternative interpretations of the situation that allow for the possibility of positive outcomes or at least neutral events. For example, 'It was an inconvenience, but I can reschedule to see my girlfriend later.'\n5. Reframe the Thought: Based on our discussion, we will work on reframing your initial thought. Instead of 'I'm a victim of bad luck,' we might rephrase it to 'Sometimes things don't go as planned, but I can adapt and find solutions.'\n6. Develop Coping Strategies: We will explore healthier coping strategies to manage stress when unexpected events occur. This can include practicing mindfulness, engaging in physical activity, or reaching out to friends for support rather than turning to substances.\n7. Practice and Follow-Up: I'll encourage you to practice identifying and challenging catastrophic thoughts in daily situations.

Introduce the Concept and Identify the Target: We will begin by discussing your feelings of overwhelm regarding your PhD project and the 'should' statements that are contributing to your anxiety. We'll identify how these thoughts lead to catastrophic conclusions about your abilities and worth as a candidate.\n2. Explore the Catastrophic Thoughts: I will ask you to describe the worst-case scenarios you envision if you do not meet your self-imposed deadlines or if your project does not progress as you expect. We will write these down to make them more tangible.\n3. Evaluate the Likelihood: Together, we will assess the reality of these catastrophic outcomes. I will guide you through questions like: 'What evidence do you have that these outcomes will actually happen?' and 'Have you faced difficulties before? What happened then?'.\n4. Challenge the Thoughts: We will work to challenge the validity of these catastrophic thoughts by looking for more balanced, realistic perspectives. I'll prompt you with questions such as 'What would you tell a friend in your situation?' and 'What are some potential outcomes that are less extreme than your worst-case scenario?'.\n5. Create a More Balanced Perspective: Once we have explored these thoughts, I will help you formulate a new, more balanced statement to replace the catastrophic thoughts. For example, instead of thinking 'I should have finished by now; I'm a failure,' we can reframe it as 'I'm working hard on a complex project, and it's normal for it to take time.'\n6. Take Action Steps: We will discuss manageable steps you can take to move forward with your project. This might include setting smaller, achievable goals or scheduling regular work sessions to establish a routine without overwhelming yourself.\n7. Practice and Reinforcement: Finally, I will encourage you to practice recognizing and challenging any 'should' statements or catastrophic thoughts as they arise.

Challenge the Comparisons: Next, we will explore the validity of comparing yourself to others. I will ask: 'What do you know about their circumstances? Are they truly better or is it an unfair comparison?'\n5. Reassess Your Beliefs: After gathering evidence, I will help you reassess your beliefs about your work ethic and capabilities. We'll consider questions like: 'What would you say to a friend who felt this way?' and 'How would you rate your success on a scale from 1 to 10, based on your own achievements?'\n6. Develop a Balanced Perspective: We will work together to create a balanced statement that acknowledges your hard work and achievements without undermining yourself through comparison. For example: 'While others may publish more, my contributions are valuable and I am progressing in my own right.'\n7. Set Actionable Goals: Finally, we will set small, actionable goals to focus on your personal progress and reduce the tendency to compare.

(e.g., times when friends supported you despite your struggles)\n   - Are there instances where being honest about your feelings has strengthened your relationships?\n4. Evaluate the Validity: We will examine the evidence you've gathered and evaluate the validity of your thoughts. I'll encourage you to consider alternative interpretations of the situation, focusing on the possibility that your friends may appreciate your honesty and vulnerability.\n5. Reframe the Thoughts: After evaluating the evidence, we will work on reframing your automatic thoughts. For example, instead of believing 'I must appear strong to be accepted,' we might reframe it to 'My friends care about me and will accept me even when I'm not feeling my best.'\n6. Practice Self-Compassion: We will discuss the importance of self-compassion and how acknowledging your pain does not make you less lovable. I will encourage you to practice self-kindness by reminding yourself that everyone has struggles and it’s okay to show vulnerability.\n7.

Identify Specific Thoughts: I will ask you to share specific thoughts you have when considering your personal projects and the reasons for your procrastination. We'll explore your auto thought: 'What's the point? No one will know it's me, and I'm not getting paid or acknowledged.' 3. Gather Evidence: Together, we will list evidence for and against this thought. For example, what are some positive outcomes you have experienced from engaging in personal projects, even if they weren't acknowledged? 4. Challenge the Thought: I will guide you through a series of questions to critically evaluate the validity of your belief that your efforts are meaningless. Questions may include: 'Have you ever enjoyed the process of creating something for yourself?' and 'What do you think you would gain from completing a project, even if no one else sees it?' 5. Reframe the Thought: Based on our discussion, we will work to create a more balanced thought. For instance, instead of 'I shouldn't do things for my own enjoyment,' we might reframe it to 'Engaging in personal projects can bring me joy and fulfillment, regardless of external acknowledgment.' 6. Practice and Integration: I will encourage you to experiment by setting small, manageable goals for your personal projects. After completing them, we will reflect on the feelings and thoughts that arise. This practice will help reinforce the value of personal fulfillment and challenge the belief that productivity is the only measure of worth. 7. Conclude with Reflection: We will end the session by reflecting on what you've learned and how you can apply this perspective moving forward, emphasizing that self-worth can come from intrinsic satisfaction rather than external validation.",

Explore Alternatives: Together, we will explore alternative perspectives on time and worth. We will discuss how personal development and relaxation can also be valuable and fulfilling activities. 5. Create a Balanced Thought: Based on the evidence gathered, we will work together to create a balanced thought to replace the 'should' statement. This could be something like: 'Taking time for myself is valuable, and I am not defined solely by my productivity.' 6.

We'll write these fears down to examine them closely.\n3. Challenge Catastrophic Thoughts: Together, we will evaluate the validity of these fears. I will guide you through questions like: \"What evidence do you have that supports these predictions? Have there been positive changes in Ivan's behavior?\" This will help in identifying any exaggerations in your thinking.\n4. Examine Likelihood and Consequences: We will discuss the likelihood of your feared outcomes occurring. What is the probability that something bad will happen compared to it not happening? We will also explore what you could do if those feared outcomes did occur, to ensure you feel more prepared and empowered.\n5. Create a Balanced Perspective: Based on our discussion, we will work together to formulate a more balanced thought about intimacy. For example, instead of thinking \"If I let my guard down, I will be hurt again,\" we might reframe it to \"While there is a risk in being vulnerable, I have the ability to communicate my needs and boundaries with Ivan.\"\n6. Develop Coping Strategies: We will identify coping strategies to help you manage anxiety when it arises. This may include grounding techniques, mindfulness, or communicating openly with Ivan about your feelings and boundaries.\n7. Practice and Reinforcement: As a concluding exercise, I will encourage you to practice reframing your thoughts in real-life situations where you feel anxious about intimacy.

Introduce the Concept: Begin the session by explaining the concept of Evidence-Based Questioning and how it can help challenge the negative thoughts related to feeling inadequate in supporting Jersey.

Identify Automatic Thoughts: Ask the client to share their automatic thoughts about not being able to help Jersey and the feelings of guilt and disappointment that arise from it. Write these thoughts down for reference.\n3. Gather Evidence: Guide the client to examine the evidence for and against their beliefs. For example, ask questions like: 'What evidence do you have that Jersey feels disappointed in you?' or 'What have you done in the past that demonstrates your support?' Encourage the client to recall specific instances where they have been helpful or supportive.\n4. Challenge the Thoughts: Help the client to see if there are alternative explanations or perspectives. Questions to consider include: 'Could Jersey understand that you are also facing challenges?' or 'Is it realistic to think you can always prioritize others' needs over your own?' \n5. Reassess the Beliefs: After gathering evidence, ask the client how they feel about their initial thoughts. Have them rate the intensity of their feelings of guilt on a scale from 1 to 10 before and after the questioning process to observe any changes.\n6.

Introduce Reality Testing: We will begin by discussing your feelings of overwhelming uncertainty and the belief that you cannot handle your financial situation. I will explain the concept of reality testing as a way to challenge these intense fears and explore the actual evidence surrounding your situation.\n2. Identify the Catastrophic Thoughts: Together, we will list your most distressing thoughts related to your financial struggles, such as 'I can't afford everything' and 'I am powerless.' We will clarify what these thoughts imply about your current situation and future.\n3. Gather Evidence: I will guide you to examine the evidence for and against these catastrophic beliefs. We will look at your current financial situation, any resources you may have (like social support), and your past experiences where you successfully managed challenges. Questions to consider will include: 'What have you managed to pay for so far?' and 'How have you coped with difficult situations in the past?'\n4. Challenge the Catastrophic Thinking: After gathering evidence, we will assess the validity of your initial thoughts. I will encourage you to reflect on questions such as: 'Is it true that there are no options available to you?' and 'What would you tell a friend in your situation who feels helpless?'\n5. Create a Balanced Thought: Based on the examination of evidence, we will work on reframing your thoughts. Instead of thinking 'I cannot handle this,' we can rephrase it to something more balanced, such as 'I am facing challenges, but I have handled difficulties before and have support.'\n6. Develop Action Steps: Together, we will create a list of concrete actions you can take to address your financial concerns, such as budgeting or seeking financial advice. This will help you feel more empowered and less overwhelmed.\n7. Homework Assignment: To reinforce this new perspective, I will ask you to keep a thought diary over the next week, noting any instances when you notice yourself slipping back into catastrophic thinking. We will review this in the next session to continue the process of reality testing and reframing.",

Analyze the Evidence: We will critically evaluate the evidence gathered and how it relates to your automatic thoughts. I will ask you to consider if there are alternative explanations for your friends' behavior, such as their own struggles or busy lives.\n6.

For example, instead of thinking 'Nobody wants to be around me,' we might revise it to 'Some friends may be struggling, and it doesn’t reflect my worth as a person.'\n7.

Explore Emotional Reasoning: Discuss how feelings of anxiety and sadness may not reflect reality. Ask: 'Just because you feel unsupported, does it mean your parents are actually being critical?' 5. Address Catastrophizing: Help the client recognize that thinking everyone will abandon them is a distortion. Use questions like: 'Have there been times when you felt alone and people surprised you with their support?' 6. Develop Counter-Thoughts: Encourage the client to create realistic, balanced statements about their parents' potential support and understanding. 7.

Practice: As a follow-up exercise, you'll practice reframing any future catastrophic thoughts using the Decatastrophizing technique in daily situations.",

Identify the Automatic Thought: We will identify your automatic thought, which is 'I need to skip the movie and support my friend, otherwise she would be greatly hurt.' Together, we will explore the emotional impact this thought has on you.\n3. Challenge the Thought: I will encourage you to question the evidence of this thought. For example, we will ask:\n   - What evidence do you have that your friend would be greatly hurt if you went to the movie?\n   - How often have you been able to support your friend while also taking care of your own needs?\n   - What would you say to a friend in your situation who felt guilty for wanting to enjoy something?\n4. Gather Evidence: As we discuss these questions, we will compile evidence that contradicts the automatic thought. This may include past experiences where prioritizing your own needs did not negatively impact your relationships.\n5. Reassess the Emotion: After challenging the thought, we will evaluate how your feelings have changed. Does the guilt still feel as intense, or has it shifted?\n6. Reframe the Perspective: Based on the evidence gathered, we will work together to create a more balanced thought. For example, 'I can support my friend and still enjoy my own life. Taking care of myself does not make me a bad person.'\n7. Practice and Link to Behavior: To reinforce this new perspective, I will encourage you to practice questioning your thoughts in future situations where you feel guilty for prioritizing your own needs.

Introduction: We will start by discussing your feelings of pressure during conversations with your parents about future plans and the associated thoughts that arise, particularly focusing on the catastrophic thinking about your job prospects and feelings of helplessness.\n2. Identify Catastrophic Thoughts: I will help you articulate the specific catastrophic thoughts you have, such as believing you are incapable of improving your job situation or that your family should always offer support. We'll explore how these thoughts may be impacting your emotions and behaviors.\n3. Assess the Realism: We will analyze these thoughts together, asking questions like: \"What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts these beliefs?\" and \"What is the worst that could realistically happen if you do not get the support you expect from your family?\" This will help you to see the exaggerated nature of these thoughts.\n4. Explore Alternatives: We will brainstorm alternative scenarios that are less extreme but still plausible. For instance, consider what it would mean if you did not find a better job immediately, or if your family did not provide the support you wish for.\n5. Reality Check: We will work to identify past experiences where outcomes were less severe than anticipated or where you overcame challenges. This will help create a more balanced perspective on your current situation.\n6. Reframe Thoughts: Together, we will create more balanced thoughts to replace the catastrophic ones, such as: \"I am capable of finding a better job, and while it may take time, I can take steps to improve my situation.\" This reframing will aim to reduce feelings of helplessness and increase your self-efficacy.\n7. Practice: As homework, you will identify moments in the coming week when you notice catastrophic thinking.

For example, instead of 'I will fail on this project,' we might reframe it to 'I have faced challenges before and have made progress, and I can manage my workload.' \n5. Develop Coping Strategies: We will brainstorm coping strategies to manage your anxiety as you work on the project. This may include setting smaller, achievable goals and incorporating breaks into your routine to reduce stress. \n6. Practice Decatastrophizing: Your task will be to practice decatastrophizing during the week. Each time you notice catastrophic thoughts, I encourage you to apply the questions we’ve discussed. \n7. Review Progress: In our next session, we will review how using these techniques has affected your anxiety and project work. We will adjust our strategies as needed to ensure continuous progress.",

Identify Specific Catastrophic Thoughts: Together, we will identify specific thoughts related to your fears about decision-making, such as 'If I make the wrong choice, my life will be ruined.' \n3. Challenge the Catastrophic Thoughts: I will guide you through questioning these thoughts by asking: 'What evidence do you have that making a wrong choice will have such severe consequences? Have you ever made a choice that didn’t lead to a disaster?' \n4. Explore Alternative Outcomes: We will brainstorm alternative outcomes for your decisions, including positive or neutral results. This will help illustrate that even the worst-case scenario may not be as catastrophic as it seems. \n5. Assess the Likelihood: I will ask you to consider the actual likelihood of the worst-case scenario happening. We will weigh the probabilities and discuss how often your fears have materialized in the past. \n6.

Identify Specific Thoughts: I will ask you to share specific thoughts that lead you to feel incompetent and pathetic. For example, what thoughts run through your mind when you consider your educational and career aspirations?\n3. Challenge the Thoughts: We will utilize evidence-based questioning to examine the validity of these thoughts. I'll guide you with questions such as:\n   - What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you are incompetent?\n   - Can you think of instances where you have succeeded or made progress, even if it feels small?\n   - How do you define success, and does your definition allow for growth and learning?\n4. Explore Alternative Explanations: After evaluating the evidence, we will explore alternative explanations for your feelings. This includes discussing your husband's ambitions and your own career path without labeling them as failures. \n5. Reframe the Thoughts: Together, we will work on reframing the negative thoughts into more balanced perspectives. For instance, instead of labeling yourself as a failure, we might reframe it to acknowledge that while you are facing challenges, that does not define your entire worth or potential.\n6. Practice Self-Compassion: I will encourage you to practice self-compassion by recognizing that everyone experiences setbacks. We will discuss ways to be kinder to yourself when you face difficulties in your career and personal life.\n7. Link to Future Actions: Finally, we will create a plan for actionable steps you can take towards your goals, focusing on small, achievable tasks to build confidence and resilience.

We'll write this down to visualize the thought.\n3. Assess the Likelihood: Next, we will evaluate the likelihood of this worst-case scenario happening. I will guide you with questions like, 'What evidence do you have that this will definitely happen?' and 'Have there been times in the past when you expected the worst but things turned out differently?'\n4. Explore Alternatives: We will brainstorm and discuss other possible outcomes that are less extreme than your worst-case scenario. I will encourage you to think of a range of potential outcomes, from positive to neutral, and we will list these together.\n5. Reframe the Thought: After establishing a more balanced view of the situation, we will work on reframing your original thought. For example, instead of thinking 'I'm never going to find a job,' we might shift to 'Finding a job can be challenging, but I have skills and experiences that are valuable, and I can keep trying.'\n6. Create an Action Plan: We will outline practical steps you can take moving forward to continue your job search and reduce feelings of helplessness. This may include setting daily or weekly goals, reaching out to connections, or exploring new career paths.\n7.

For example, we can explore: 'What is the best-case scenario?' and 'What would you tell a friend in your situation?' This will help shift focus from fear-based thinking to more balanced perspectives.\n5. Reframe the Thoughts: Based on the evidence and alternative outcomes we've discussed, we will work together to reframe the catastrophic thoughts into more realistic, balanced statements. For instance, transforming 'I cannot trust him' into 'I have reasons to be cautious, but I can communicate and clarify my feelings.'\n6. Develop a Plan for Action: We will create a plan for how you can approach Ivan in a way that fosters trust and open communication rather than confrontation. This may involve expressing your feelings without accusations and asking for transparency in a supportive manner.\n7. Practice and Link to Behavior: Finally, we will discuss strategies to practice this reframing and decatastrophizing in real-life situations, especially when feelings of anger and suspicion arise. You will be encouraged to apply these techniques and share your experiences in our next session.",

Gather Evidence: I will ask you a series of questions to help you evaluate the validity of this thought, such as: \n   - 'What evidence do you have that they are blaming you?' \n   - 'Have they explicitly communicated this, or is this an assumption?' \n   - 'What alternative explanations could there be for their behavior and comments?'\n4. Challenge the Thought: We will analyze the evidence collected, weighing both supporting and contradicting evidence. I will guide you to consider the possibility that their comments may not be personal attacks but rather reflections of their own beliefs or discomfort.\n5. Reframe the Thought: Based on the evidence gathered, we will work together to reframe your initial thought. For instance, instead of thinking 'They are blaming me,' we might reframe it to 'They may not understand my feelings, and it’s okay for me to express them.'\n6. Practice and Link to Behavior: To reinforce this new perspective, I will encourage you to practice questioning assumptions when interacting with Ivan’s family.

Challenge Cognitive Distortions: Focus on identifying specific instances where your contributions have been successful. We will ask questions such as: \"Have there been times when your ideas were accepted?\" and \"What feedback have you received from colleagues or students in the past?\" This will help in recognizing the positive impacts you have made, countering the belief of being a complete failure.\n5. Consider Alternative Outcomes: Discuss alternative explanations for the rejection. For example, was the decision based on factors outside of your control?

Reframe Your Thoughts: Based on the evidence gathered, we will work together to create more balanced, realistic thoughts.

Understand Catastrophic Thoughts: Together, we will identify specific catastrophic thoughts you have about not getting a job, such as 'If I don't get a job, I am a failure.' We will write these down to clarify the intensity of these beliefs.\n3. Examine the Evidence: Next, I will guide you to consider the evidence for and against these catastrophic thoughts. We will ask questions like: 'Have there been times in the past where you were unsuccessful but eventually found success?' and 'What skills do you possess that are valuable to employers?' \n4. Challenge the Thoughts: I will help you to reframe these thoughts by discussing the likelihood of the worst-case scenarios occurring. We will explore how failure in the job search doesn't define your entire worth or future.\n5. Consider Alternative Outcomes: We will brainstorm potential positive outcomes of your job search that you may not have considered, including the skills and experiences you are gaining through the process.\n6. Create a Balanced Perspective: Using the evidence gathered, we will work on creating a more balanced thought, such as 'While it’s frustrating not to receive offers right now, it doesn't mean I’m a failure. My efforts are valuable and I can continue to improve.'\n7. Develop Coping Strategies: Finally, we will establish practical coping strategies for managing feelings of anxiety and hopelessness during the job search, including setting realistic daily goals and allowing time for social activities to maintain balance in your life.",

'Have there been times when Ivan has shown commitment or effort that you might be overlooking?'\n4. Challenge Comparisons: Discuss the validity of her comparisons. Ask, 'What does it mean to be successful in a job search? Is it possible for two people to take different paths and still be successful in their own ways?'\n5. Reevaluate Self-Perception: Encourage Sophia to reflect on her worth outside of her partner's actions. Questions could include: 'How do you define your own success?' 'What strengths and qualities do you bring to your relationship with Ivan that are independent of his job search?'\n6. Reframe the Thought: Work together to create a balanced thought that reduces the pressure of comparison and 'should' statements. For instance, 'Ivan's journey is different from mine, and it doesn’t reflect my worth or success.'\n7.

We'll identify the cognitive distortions at play, particularly Mind Reading (assuming your mother only calls with bad news) and Catastrophizing (believing you can't handle serious discussions about your father's health). 2. Identify Automatic Thoughts: Together, we will pinpoint your automatic thoughts during the call, such as 'My mom only calls me with bad news' and 'I'm too scared to talk to my parents about serious matters.' 3. Challenge Assumptions: Using Evidence-Based Questioning, we will challenge these thoughts by asking: - 'What evidence do you have that your mother only calls with bad news?' - 'Have there been times when she called to share positive news?' - 'What would happen if you initiated a serious conversation with your parents?' 4. Gather Evidence: We will create a list of evidence that contradicts your current beliefs. For instance, exploring past interactions with your parents that were supportive or positive. 5. Re-assess Feelings: After gathering evidence, we will re-assess how you feel about the possibility of discussing your father's health. Does the evidence change your perception of your ability to handle these conversations? 6. Reframe the Thoughts: Work together to reframe the automatic thoughts based on the new evidence. Instead of thinking 'I'm too scared to talk to my parents,' we might change it to 'It’s understandable to feel scared, but I can reach out and discuss important issues.' 7. Practice New Skills: As an exercise, set a small goal to initiate a light conversation with your parents about everyday topics, gradually moving towards more serious discussions. We will discuss how to prepare for these conversations and reinforce the idea that open communication can strengthen your family relationships.",

Challenge Negative Beliefs: Prompt the client to question the validity of their thoughts. For instance, I will ask, 'What evidence do you have that your father will pass away soon? What has been his health management like?' This will promote a more balanced perspective.\n5. Consider Alternatives: Encourage the client to think of alternative scenarios that are less catastrophic. We will brainstorm potential positive outcomes or neutral scenarios regarding their father's health.\n6.

Explore Counter-Evidence: We will work to uncover positive experiences from past family gatherings or interactions that contradict your current beliefs. This might include any moments of connection or support you've experienced. 5.

This might include breathing exercises, positive affirmations, or a plan to engage in specific conversations that have gone well in the past. 7.

Challenge the Thoughts: I will guide you to question these thoughts by exploring the evidence against them. We will ask questions such as: 'Has feeling sad ever made you a weak person?' and 'Can sadness coexist with strength and resilience?' This will help you see that emotions do not define your worth or strength.\n4. Explore Alternative Perspectives: We will work to identify alternative ways of viewing your emotions. For example, feeling sad about your brother's death can be seen as a testament to the love you have for him and a natural response to loss, rather than a sign of weakness.\n5. Reframe Emotional Reactions: I will help you create a new narrative about your emotional responses. Instead of thinking 'I am weak for feeling this way,' we will reframe it to 'I am human, and it is okay to feel sad about my brother's death; it shows my capacity to love and remember him.'\n6. Develop Coping Strategies: We will discuss practical ways to manage these emotions when they arise, such as journaling about your feelings or finding a supportive friend or family member to talk to. We will also explore grounding techniques to help you stay present and reduce overwhelming emotions.\n7.

Identify Emotional Beliefs: We will explore the auto thought, 'I feel detached and unable to fully engage with my own experiences and emotions,' and identify specific beliefs this thought triggers, such as 'I am unlovable.' 3. Gather Evidence: I will guide you to examine the evidence supporting and contradicting your feelings. This will include reflecting on times when you have engaged fully with your emotions or connected with others. 4. Challenge Emotional Reasoning: Using evidence-based questioning, I will ask you to consider: 'What evidence do I have that contradicts the belief that I am unlovable when I feel detached?' and 'Have there been moments where I felt engaged and connected?' 5. Reassess Emotional Impact: After gathering evidence, we will reassess how this new information influences your feelings of detachment. I will ask, 'Given this evidence, how true does it feel to say I am unlovable?' 6. Develop Compassionate Self-Statements: We will work together to create new, evidence-based self-statements that reflect your worth and capability to connect with emotions, such as 'I am capable of feeling and expressing my emotions, and my feelings of detachment do not define my worth.' 7. Practice and Integration: Finally, we will discuss strategies for practicing these new beliefs in daily life and how to apply evidence-based questioning when you notice emotional reasoning affecting your self-view.

Identify Negative Thoughts: Together, we will identify the specific negative thoughts that have arisen from this situation, such as 'I am irresponsible like my friend's husband' and 'I must have a financial cushion or I am irresponsible.'\n3. Gather Evidence: I will guide you to gather evidence for and against these thoughts. We will ask questions like: 'What evidence do you have that you are irresponsible?' and 'Have there been times when you managed your finances well?' This will help you to see a more balanced view of your financial behavior.\n4. Challenge Assumptions: Next, we will address the assumptions behind your thoughts. For example, we will explore what being 'irresponsible' means and whether that label truly applies to you. I will ask you to consider: 'Is it possible that everyone struggles with finances at times?' and 'What does it mean to have a financial cushion?' \n5. Reframe the Thoughts: After examining the evidence, we will work together to create alternative statements that are more balanced and realistic. For instance, instead of 'I am irresponsible,' you might say, 'I am learning to manage my finances better, and it's okay to seek help when I need it.'\n6. Develop an Action Plan: We will create a small, manageable action plan to address your finances, like setting a budget or scheduling time to review your expenses. This will empower you to take control of your financial situation and reduce feelings of helplessness.\n7. Practice and Follow-Up: Finally, I will encourage you to practice using Evidence-Based Questioning in everyday situations where you feel overwhelmed.

Start with the Pros of trying to meet everyone’s needs (e.g., maintaining friendships, feeling valued) and then move to the Cons (e.g., feeling drained, neglecting personal needs).\n4. Explore Emotional Impacts: Discuss how these thoughts and actions make the client feel emotionally. Ask questions like, 'What emotions come up when you think about not being able to satisfy everyone's needs?' This may help in identifying the emotional reasoning behind their thoughts.\n5. Assess Realistic Outcomes: Evaluate the likelihood of the worst-case scenarios they fear. Encourage the client to think critically about whether failing to meet everyone's needs would lead to the disastrous outcomes they imagine.\n6. Reframe the Thought: After reviewing the Pros and Cons, work together to reframe the automatic thought. For example, shift from 'I can't satisfy everyone's needs' to 'I can prioritize my needs while still being supportive to my friends.'\n7. Develop an Action Plan: Create a plan for the convention that includes setting clear boundaries and practicing saying no when necessary. Encourage the client to articulate their needs to their friends and identify specific situations where they can assert these boundaries. \n8. Homework Assignment: For the next week, ask the client to keep a journal of situations where they felt pressured to meet others' needs and how they managed those situations.

Discuss Implications: Talk about how holding onto harsh labels can affect their behavior and relationships. Discuss the importance of empathy and understanding in professional environments. 7.

Identify Catastrophic Thoughts: Together, we will identify specific thoughts that are driving your anxiety, such as 'My stomach problems might not heal' and 'There could be something else preventing healing.'\n3. Challenge the Catastrophic Thoughts: We will evaluate the likelihood of these catastrophic outcomes occurring. I will ask questions like: 'What evidence do you have that your stomach problems won't heal? What are the chances of the worst-case scenario happening?' \n4. Create a Balanced Perspective: I will guide you in formulating a more balanced thought, focusing on the evidence that suggests healing is possible and that you have taken steps towards managing your health.\n5. Develop a Coping Plan: We will create a plan for coping with anxiety when it arises, including grounding techniques and strategies to challenge unhelpful thoughts in real-time.\n6. Practice Mindfulness: I will introduce mindfulness exercises to help you stay present and reduce ruminating thoughts about your health.\n7. Review Progress: At the end of the session, we will discuss any changes in your feelings of anxiety and how the techniques can be employed in daily situations to combat catastrophic thinking.",

Introduce the Concept and Identify the Target: We will start by discussing your concerns about fearing the loss of positive aspects of life and the belief that something bad will happen. We'll identify how this thinking leads to anxiety and prevents you from enjoying your current well-being. I will introduce the Decatastrophizing technique to challenge these catastrophic thoughts.\n2. Identify Specific Fears: I will ask you to articulate the specific worst-case scenarios that you are imagining. What exactly do you think will happen if you lose what you have?\n3. Reality Check: Together, we will evaluate the likelihood of these worst-case scenarios happening. I will prompt you with questions such as: 'How often have your worst fears come true in the past?' and 'What evidence do you have that this will happen again?'\n4. Assess the Impact: We will discuss the actual impact of these feared outcomes. If the worst were to happen, how would you cope? What resources or strengths do you have that would help you manage the situation?\n5. Develop a Balanced Perspective: After assessing the evidence, we will work together to create a more balanced thought. For example, instead of thinking 'I'm going to lose what I have,' we might reframe it to 'I can enjoy my current happiness and deal with challenges as they arise.'\n6. Practice Using the Technique: I will encourage you to practice this technique outside of our session. Whenever you find yourself imagining catastrophic outcomes, use the questions we discussed to challenge those thoughts and develop a more realistic perspective.\n7. Link to Behavioral Changes: Finally, we will connect this reframing to your behaviors. How can you allow yourself to enjoy the positive aspects of your life more fully, knowing you have coping strategies in place if challenges arise?",

Role-Play: As practice, conduct a role-play of the conversation with their mother, allowing the client to express their feelings in a controlled setting.

Gather Evidence: I will guide you in listing specific examples of interactions with your coworkers. We will ask questions like, 'What evidence do you have that supports this belief?' and 'What evidence contradicts this thought?' 4. Challenge the Thoughts: Together, we will analyze the evidence and identify any assumptions or biases in your thinking. We will explore alternative explanations for your coworkers' behavior that are less negative and more neutral or positive. 5. Reframe the Thought: Based on our exploration, we will work on reframing your automatic thought to something more balanced, such as 'I don't know what my coworkers think, and there are many possible interpretations of their behavior.' 6. Link to Behavior: We will discuss how adopting this new perspective can impact your interactions with coworkers and encourage you to engage more openly with them.

Explore Past Experiences: We'll reflect on past interactions with friends to gather evidence that contradicts the idea that you are unwanted or unlovable. I will prompt you with questions like:  \n- 'Can you recall a time when you felt included or appreciated by your friends?'  \n- 'How did those friends demonstrate their care for you?'  \n5.

I will introduce the Decatastrophizing technique to challenge these overwhelming feelings and thoughts.\n2. Identify Catastrophic Thoughts: Together, we will list the worst-case scenarios you envision when you think about visiting Yvonne. For example, 'If I don't go, Yvonne will struggle even more, and I will be a bad friend.'\n3. Evaluate Likelihood and Evidence: We will examine these catastrophic thoughts by assessing the likelihood of these outcomes happening. I will ask questions such as: 'What evidence do you have that Yvonne cannot manage her situation without your help?' and 'Have there been times when you were not available, but things worked out for her?' \n4. Challenge the Catastrophic Thoughts: I will help you to challenge the validity of these thoughts by discussing the potential positive outcomes, such as Yvonne finding her own solutions or you setting healthy boundaries.\n5. Create a Balanced Perspective: We will work together to create a more balanced thought, such as: 'While I want to support Yvonne, it's also important for me to take care of my own emotional health. I can help her without sacrificing my well-being.'\n6. Develop an Action Plan: We will create a plan for your visit that includes setting boundaries for how long you will stay or how much emotional energy you can invest, allowing you to support Yvonne while also protecting your own mental health.\n7. Practice and Reflect: To reinforce this technique, we will discuss how you can apply the Decatastrophizing method in future situations.

Reframe the Belief: Work together to reframe their belief about their role and responsibilities. Create a statement that reflects a more balanced view, such as: 'While I care about my friends, I am not solely responsible for their happiness; I can also prioritize my own needs.' \n6. Discuss Boundaries: Talk about the importance of setting boundaries to maintain their well-being. Explore feelings of guilt associated with this and how to manage those feelings.\n7.

Gather Evidence: I will guide you to critically evaluate these thoughts by asking questions like: 'What evidence do you have that supports this thought?' and 'What evidence contradicts this thought?' This will involve looking at past successes, skills, and positive feedback from others.\n4. Challenge the Assumptions: We will explore the assumptions behind your thoughts. I will ask, 'What would you say to a friend who had similar thoughts?' This will help you to view your situation from a different perspective and counteract the emotional reasoning.\n5. Generate Alternative Thoughts: Based on the evidence gathered, we will work together to create more balanced and realistic thoughts. For example, instead of thinking, 'I might not succeed,' we might frame it as, 'I have skills and experience that can help me succeed, and challenges are part of the journey.'\n6.

Introduce the Concept: Begin by explaining the concept of catastrophizing and how it relates to the client's feelings of being overwhelmed by the logistics of fulfilling their father's wishes. Emphasize that we will work on reframing these thoughts to reduce anxiety.\n2. Identify Specific Thoughts: Ask the client to share specific thoughts that are contributing to their anxiety about the logistics. For example, inquire about the worst-case scenarios they envision and how they believe they must fulfill their father's wishes perfectly.\n3. Challenge Catastrophic Thoughts: Guide the client in identifying evidence that contradicts their catastrophic thoughts. Ask questions like, \"What evidence do you have that this situation is as dire as you believe?\" and \"Have others faced similar situations and managed to fulfill their loved one's wishes?\"\n4. Explore the Likelihood of Worst-Case Scenarios: Help the client evaluate the actual likelihood of the worst-case scenarios occurring. Use a scale of 0-100% to rate the probabilities of these scenarios happening and discuss why these ratings may be lower than initially thought.\n5. Generate Alternative Outcomes: Encourage the client to brainstorm alternative outcomes that are more positive or manageable. Ask them what steps they can take to address their concerns and how they might feel empowered by taking action.\n6. Create a Plan of Action: Work with the client to outline a realistic plan for managing the logistics involved in fulfilling their father's wishes. Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps to reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.\n7. Reframe the Narrative: Together, create a new narrative that acknowledges the challenges but also recognizes the client's strengths and capabilities. This might include statements like, \"I can take things one step at a time, and it's okay to seek help when I need it.\"\n8. Practice and Reflect: Assign the client the task of writing down any catastrophic thoughts they have in the coming week and reframing them using the techniques discussed in the session.

Introduce the Concept and Identify the Target: Begin by discussing the client's feelings about the eventual passing of their father and grandmother.

Identify Catastrophic Thoughts: We'll list the specific catastrophic thoughts that arise when contemplating these deaths, such as fears of guilt and judgment from others.\n3. Challenge Catastrophic Thoughts: Discuss the validity of these thoughts. Ask questions like: \"What evidence do you have that feeling relief is wrong?\" and \"How can you hold both relief and sadness at the same time?\"\n4. Reality Testing: Explore scenarios around the passing of both family members. Discuss the outcomes that might occur and the likelihood of each happening. This will help the client see that not all thoughts lead to dire consequences.\n5. Reframe the Thoughts: Work with the client to create a more balanced perspective on their feelings. For example, instead of thinking, \"I shouldn't feel relief,\" reframe it to, \"It's natural to have mixed emotions about death. Feeling relief doesn't mean I don't care.\"\n6. Develop Coping Strategies: Equip the client with tools to handle guilt and anxiety when these feelings arise, such as journaling about their thoughts or speaking to a trusted friend.\n7. Practice and Link to Behavior: Encourage the client to practice reframing these thoughts in real-time and to discuss their feelings more openly with supportive family members.

For example, 'Could it be possible that Ethan's choices are his own and not a reflection of your worth or judgment?'\n5. Reframe the Thoughts: Based on our discussion, we will work together to reframe your thoughts. Instead of 'I need to fix this,' we might say 'I can support Ethan, but I am not responsible for his choices.' \n6. Practice Self-Compassion: I'll introduce self-compassion exercises, encouraging you to acknowledge your feelings without judgment and recognize that it's okay not to have control over others' actions. \n7.
